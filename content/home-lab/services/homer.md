# "My first website"

I never thought that I would need a web dashboard for all of my web-based self-hosted services. Back then, I had one service. Maybe two.

But, one day, I had far too many services to keep track of. All of the local IP addresses, all of the port numbers, which ones were 'http' versus 'https,' etc. It got to be very onerous.

This is when I decided to configure a Homer dashboard.

Life-changer.

This is a screenshot of part of my Homer dashboard.
